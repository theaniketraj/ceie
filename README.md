## **Introduction**

CEIE is designed to help developers manage complex environments with ease. Whether you are a solo developer or part of a larger team, CEIE offers a robust solution to automate the setup of Git repositories, improve your branching strategy, and streamline deployment with CI/CD pipelines.

---

## **Features**

- **Automatic Repository Setup:** Create and manage repositories with three default branches:
  - **Main:** For production-ready code.
  - **Controlled Environment:** For team review and testing.
  - **Isolated Environment:** For individual offline work.
  
- **Custom Git Command:** `git setup-ceie` â€“ A command that automates the creation of the default branching structure.

- **CI/CD Automation:** Seamlessly integrates GitHub Actions to automate deployment processes based on branch merges.

- **Reusable Scripts:** Create workflows that can be used across multiple repositories.

- **Scalable:** Easily extendable and customizable to fit your needs, whether for small teams or large organizations.
